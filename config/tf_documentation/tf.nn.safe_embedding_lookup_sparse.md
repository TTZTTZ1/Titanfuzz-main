Lookup embedding results, accounting for invalid IDs and empty features.

```
tf.nn.safe_embedding_lookup_sparse(
    embedding_weights,
    sparse_ids,
    sparse_weights=None,
    combiner='mean',
    default_id=None,
    max_norm=None,
    name=None,
    allow_fast_lookup=False
)
```

The partitioned embedding in `embedding_weights` must all be the same shape
except for the first dimension. The first dimension is allowed to vary as the
vocabulary size is not necessarily a multiple of num of shards.

This is similar to [`tf.nn.embedding_lookup_sparse`](https://tensorflow.google.cn/api_docs/python/tf/nn/embedding_lookup_sparse), except invalid IDs (< 0)
are pruned from input IDs and weights, as well as any IDs with non-positive
weight. For an entry with no features, the embedding vector for `default_id`
is returned, or the 0-vector if `default_id` is not supplied. See
[`tf.nn.embedding_lookup_sparse`](https://tensorflow.google.cn/api_docs/python/tf/nn/embedding_lookup_sparse) for more information on how sparse embedding
lookups work in general.

The ids and weights may be multi-dimensional `SparseTensor`s or
`RaggedTensor`s with rank of 2. For `SpareTensor`s with left-aligned non-zero
entries which can be described as `RaggedTensor`s, use of `RaggedTensor`s can
yield higher performance.

If `len(embedding_weights) > 1`, each element `id` of `ids` is partitioned
between the elements of `embedding_weights` according to the "div" partition
strategy, which means we assign ids to partitions in a contiguous manner. For
instance, 13 ids are split across 5 partitions as:
`[[0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8], [9, 10], [11, 12]]`.

If the id space does not evenly divide the number of partitions, each of the
first `(max_id + 1) % len(embedding_weights)` partitions will be assigned one
more id.

| Args | |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| `embedding_weights` | A single tensor representing the complete embedding tensor, or a list of tensors all of same shape except for the first dimension, representing sharded embedding tensors following "div" partition strategy. |
| `sparse_ids` | `SparseTensor` of shape `[d_0, d_1, ..., d_n]` containing the ids, where `d_0` is typically batch size, or a `RaggedTensor` with rank 2. |
| `sparse_weights` | `SparseTensor` or `RaggedTensor` of same type and shape as `sparse_ids`, containing float weights corresponding to `sparse_ids`, or `None` if all weights are assumed to be 1.0. |
| `combiner` | A string specifying how to combine embedding results for each entry. Currently "mean", "sqrtn" and "sum" are supported, with "mean" the default. |
| `default_id` | The id to use for an entry with no features. Defaults to 0-vector. |
| `max_norm` | If not `None`, all embeddings are l2-normalized to max\_norm before combining. |
| `name` | A name for this operation (optional). |
| `allow_fast_lookup` | An optional boolean specifying whether to allow simplified embedding lookups when `params` is a single tensor and `max_norm` is `None`. Setting this flag to `True` during training can cause the use of dense gradients with increased memory footprint. |

| Returns | |
| A dense tensor representing the combined embeddings for the sparse ids. For each row in the dense tensor represented by `sparse_ids`, the op looks up the embeddings for all ids in that row, multiplies them by the corresponding weight, and combines these embeddings as specified. | |

In other words, if

`shape(combined embedding_weights) = [p0, p1, ..., pm]`

and

`shape(sparse_ids) = shape(sparse_weights) = [d0, d1, ..., dn]`

then

`shape(output) = [d0, d1, ... dn-1, p1, ..., pm]`.

For instance, if params is a 10x20 matrix, and sp\_ids / sp\_weights are

```
  [0, 0]: id 1, weight 2.0
  [0, 1]: id 3, weight 0.5
  [1, 0]: id -1, weight 1.0
  [2, 3]: id 1, weight 3.0
```

`default_id` is 0.

with `combiner`="mean", then the output will be a 3x20 matrix where

```
  output[0, :] = (params[1, :] * 2.0 + params[3, :] * 0.5) / (2.0 + 0.5)
  output[1, :] = (params[0, :] * 1.0) / 1.0
  output[2, :] = (params[1, :] * 3.0) / 3.0
```

| Raises | |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| `ValueError` | if `embedding_weights` is empty. |
